# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis  
##  Overview  
We are given a list of employees from a hypothetical company, Pewlett-Hackard, from which we needed to obtain a list of current employees who are going to be retiring soon.  We previously generated this list and used several queries to generate several other tables filtering retiring employees based on department, manager status or to obtain the number of retiring employees in each department.  As an additional analysis we are now determining the number of employees who are retiring by their title and employees who are eligible to participate in a part time mentorship program to train employees who will replace them.  

##  Results  
- Employees with the title of Senior Engineer are going to experience the greatest number of upcoming retirements while Managers will experience the least number of upcoming retirements.  
- It appears that 90,398 current employees total will be retiring and who have a title    
- 1549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program  
- This data does not take into account hiring dates
